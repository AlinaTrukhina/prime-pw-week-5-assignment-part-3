    <ul>
      <li>I tried to use object method array.hasOwnProperty(trackName) to check for track name in my search function, but it returned "undefined" when there was a track name match. 
        Am I using the method incorrectly?</li>
      <li>When doing some research, I found that doing the search may be more efficient using object methods rather than nested for loops. 
        Do for loops take up more processing power? How do we know which method is better?</li>
    </ul>
